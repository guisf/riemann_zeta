Riemann zeros and Montgomery's Conjecture
===============================================

This directory contains the programs used to generate Riemann zeros and 
to test Montgomery's conjecture based on a transcendental equation and
an explicit formula in terms of Lambert function.

Montgomery's conjecture is verified as illustrated in this figure:
