The final zeros are in the file

`ourzeros105_final.txt`

This file agrees with Odlyzko zeros up to the 9 decimal places, which
is his last digit. Our results are more precise than this.

It was really painfull to generate this table.
We first started with the normal solution of the transcendental 
equation `zeros.findzero`. This yields  ~11.000 results different
from Odlyzko of a total of 100.000. Then we generate this bad results
with `zeros.findzero2` which replace this bad ones at about 807 different
results. Then we used mathematica with the delta perturbation and
still 45 remained different.
Then we used `zeros.findzero3` and only 1 results (n=57764) was different.
Then we corrected this one with Mathematica again with epsilon=10^-6.

The final file is not different in a single number from Odlyzko zeros1.txt
file.
